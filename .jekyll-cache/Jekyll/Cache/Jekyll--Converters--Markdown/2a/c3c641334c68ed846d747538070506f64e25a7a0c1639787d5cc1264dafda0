<p>Hello! My name is Trishala and I am currently a graduate student at Cornell University at Cornell Tech. My academic interests include natural language processing and machine learning.</p>

<p>In this blog, I plan to write about some of the projects I have worked on and interesting papers that I have read. I believe that being able the explain clearly is the best way to validate one’s own understanding of ideas. I have been meaning to set up a blog like this one for a long time, and I am very excited that I am finally doing this!</p>

<p>Some of the projects I have recently worked on include my <a href="https://goo.gl/fe8Awr">summer internship project</a> at BuzzFeed Data Science, and a <a href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM17/paper/view/15630/14864">publication</a> in AAAI 2017. I was also part of the teaching staff for <a href="https://cornelltech.github.io/cs5785-fall-2017/index.html">CS 5785 Applied Machine Learning</a> in Fall 2017.</p>

<p>Prior to coming to pursue my Masters, I got my engineering degree from BITS Pilani, India. I was a research intern at the <a href="http://ptl.sys.virginia.edu/ptl/">Predictive Technology Lab</a> at University of Virginia, where I worked on Project Sensus as part of my Bachelor’s thesis.</p>

<p>Please feel free to get in touch with me if you have comments on my posts or simply want to get in touch! My email address is tn338 @ cornell.edu. You can also find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trishala-neeraj/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
