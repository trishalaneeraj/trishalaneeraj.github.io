                Currently, I am working on my Graduate Specialization research involving relationship extraction methods in natural language processing, particularly applied to the area investigative journalism. In the recent past, I worked on topic modeling of self-disclosed textual information in online user profiles.

                Details about all my projects so far can be found on my LinkedIn profile.
