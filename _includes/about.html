                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Trishala Neeraj. I am a first-year graduate student in the Information Science Department at Cornell University at Cornell Tech. 

                I am an aspiring data scientist, currently working at the <a href="https://s.tech.cornell.edu/">Social Technologies Lab</a> as part of my graduate research. I am working on using relationship extraction in a way that aids the area of investigative journalism. Through my research, that involves Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Data Mining, I want to bring more transparency in the organizations that involve influential leaders, politicians, and other beneficiaries. My advisor is <a href="https://people.jacobs.cornell.edu/mor/">Dr. Mor Naaman</a>.

                In the past, I have worked on topic modeling of self-disclosed information in online user profiles.

                <p>
                I obtained my undergraduate degree from BITS Pilani, India, in May 2016, where I pursued a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 
                I completed my Undergraduate Thesis under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Gerber at the <a href="http://ptl.sys.virginia.edu/ptl/">Predictive Technology Laboratory</a> at University of Virginia, while I worked there as a visiting research intern.
