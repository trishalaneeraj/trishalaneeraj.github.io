                <p>Hi! My name is Trishala Neeraj. I am a first-year graduate student in the Information Science Department at Cornell University at Cornell Tech. My academic and research interests include Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

                I obtained my undergraduate degree from BITS Pilani, India, in May 2016, where I pursued a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 
                I completed my Undergraduate Thesis under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Gerber at the <a href="http://ptl.sys.virginia.edu/ptl/">Predictive Technology Laboratory</a> at University of Virginia, while I worked there as a visiting research intern. Details about all my projects can be found on my LinkedIn profile.
