                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Trishala Neeraj. I am a first-year graduate student in the Information Science Department at Cornell University at Cornell Tech. 

                 I am an aspiring data scientist, currently working at the <a href="https://s.tech.cornell.edu/">Social Technologies Lab</a> as part of my graduate research. My interests lie in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In the coming semester I will start working on my Master's Thesis that will primarily be at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Digital Journalism. I will be advised by Dr. Mor Naaman and Dr. Yoav Artzi.
                </p>

                I obtained my undergraduate degree from BITS Pilani, India, in May 2016, where I pursued a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 
                I completed my Undergraduate Thesis under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Gerber at the <a href="http://ptl.sys.virginia.edu/ptl/">Predictive Technology Laboratory</a> at University of Virginia, while I worked there as a visiting research intern.
