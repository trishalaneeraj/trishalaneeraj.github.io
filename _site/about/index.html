<p>Hi, my name is Trishala Neeraj. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at CyberCube where I use a wide variety of data to determine organizations’ cyber-risk profiles.</p>

<p>I obtained my Master’s degree in Information and Computer Science at Cornell University, based in New York City at Cornell Tech. My research, advised by <a href="https://people.jacobs.cornell.edu/mor/">Mor Naaman</a>, was focused on developing tools to assist investigative journalism, by using methods in Information Retrieval. I took coursework in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, and was part of the teaching staff for <a href="https://cornelltech.github.io/cs5785-fall-2017/index.html">CS 5785 Applied Machine Learning</a> for Fall 2017. During graduate school, I also spent some time learning and thinking about the <a href="https://medium.com/p/66120ec11854#f79f">human and social aspects of technology</a>, and contributed directly to ongoing research in the topics of Trust and Computational Social Science (<a href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM17/paper/view/15630/14864">AAAI 2017</a>). Here’s a list of other select projects I’ve worked on in the recent years -</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tech.buzzfeed.com/how-we-tagged-14-000-buzzfeed-quizzes-using-k-means-clustering-95fc46bc6daf">Blog post describing my work</a> as an intern at BuzzFeed Data Science group</li>
  <li>Cornell Tech - Google <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/news/product-challenge-google-cio/">Product Challenge</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to coming to pursue my Masters, I got my engineering degree from BITS Pilani, India. I was a research intern at the Predictive Technology Lab at the University of Virginia, where I worked on <a href="https://predictive-technology-laboratory.github.io/sensus/">Project Sensus</a> as part of my Bachelor’s thesis.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments about any of my blog posts here or my work in general, please feel free to email me at tn338 @ cornell . edu. You can also find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trishalaneeraj/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@tn338">Medium</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X2lSWUQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/trishalaneeraj">Twitter</a>.</p>
