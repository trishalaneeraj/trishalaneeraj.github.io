Hi, I am Trishala Neeraj. Currently based in San Francisco, I am working on Machine Learning problems at CyberCube. I work with a variety of data (both structured and unstructured) to determine organizations’ cyber risk profiles. 

I particularly enjoy working with language data and I've set up this blog to document personal projects and share my thoughts on research publications I find interesting. If you have any questions or comments about any of my [blog posts](http://trishalaneeraj.github.io/) here or my work in general, please feel free to email me at tn338 [at] cornell [dot] edu. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trishalaneeraj/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trishalaneeraj).

I obtained a Master of Science degree in Information and Computer Science from Cornell University, based in New York City at Cornell Tech. My research, advised by [Mor Naaman](https://people.jacobs.cornell.edu/mor/), was focused on developing tools to assist investigative journalism using Information Retrieval. During grad school, I specialized in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I also spent some time learning the human and social aspects of technology, and [collaborated with community-based organizations](https://medium.com/p/66120ec11854#f79f) in implementing sustainable technological solutions to address some of the challenges they faced. I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree from BITS Pilani, India. During that time, I worked on various projects at the Networks and Communications Laboratory (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering). Below is a selection of projects I enjoyed working on / other highlights over the past few years - 

### 2020
