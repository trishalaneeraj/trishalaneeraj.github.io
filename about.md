## About
Based in San Francisco, I currently work as part of a cross-functional team of product leaders, analysts, actuaries, and other scientists and engineers to deliver cyber-risk analytics to the global cyber-insurance market. I am experienced in working with terabyte-scale data to develop models using deep learning and matrix factorization techniques, powering numerous product features.

I particularly enjoy working with language data, and I have set up this blog to document personal research projects. If you have any questions or comments about any of my [blog posts](http://trishalaneeraj.github.io/) here or my work in general, please feel free to email me at tn338 [at] cornell [dot] edu. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trishalaneeraj/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trishalaneeraj).

## Education
I focused on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing during my graduate studies and research at Cornell University. During this time, I also had the opportunity to learn about [product development](https://tech.cornell.edu/news/video-tech-with-a-purpose/) and work actively with [community-based](https://medium.com/p/66120ec11854#f79f) as well as [big tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/news/product-challenge-google-cio/) organizations in New York City. My experiences taught me to think deeply about the sustainability of technological solutions and their human and social impact.

I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree from BITS Pilani, India. I also spent some time at the Predictive Technology Lab at University of Virginia as a visiting research scholar. I worked on projects designed and developed for research in public health.
