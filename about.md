Hello! My name is Trishala and I am currently a graduate student at Cornell University at Cornell Tech. My academic interests include natural language processing and machine learning. 

In this blog, I plan to write about some of the projects I have worked on, interesting papers I read or about an event I attended. I am going to try my best to blog regularly. I have been meaning to set up a blog like this one for a long time, and I am very excited that I am finally doing this!

Please feel free to get in touch with me if you have comments on my posts or simply want to get in touch! My email address is tn338 @ cornell.edu. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/trishala-neeraj
