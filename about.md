Hi, I am Trishala Neeraj. Currently based in San Francisco, I am working on Machine Learning problems at CyberCube. I work with a variety of data (both structured and unstructured) to determine organizations’ cyber risk profiles. 

I obtained my Master's degree in Information and Computer Science at Cornell University, based in New York City at Cornell Tech. My research, advised by [Mor Naaman](https://people.jacobs.cornell.edu/mor/), was focused on developing tools to assist investigative journalism, by using methods in Information Retrieval. During graduate school, I specialized in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing and was part of the teaching staff for [CS 5785 Applied Machine Learning](https://cornelltech.github.io/cs5785-fall-2017/index.html) for Fall 2017. I also spent some time learning and thinking about the [human and social aspects of technology](https://medium.com/p/66120ec11854#f79f), and contributed directly to ongoing research in the topics of Trust and Computational Social Science.

Here’s a selection of projects I enjoyed working on and other highlights over the past few years - 

### 2020
* Paper accepted at IEEE International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace (IEEE DSC 2020).
* Speaker at Data Insights Workshop at [Foresight 2020](https://insights.cybcube.com/foresight-2020-virtual-reality). Discussed how prior cyber events affect a company’s security posture and the likelihood of future events, showcasing results from on-going research at CyberCube.
* Mentoring a Data Science Intern for Summer 2020 at CyberCube.

### 2019
* White Paper on analysis of CyberCube's Cyber Threat Outlook Survey that collected data from domain experts' perspectives on the frequency of occurrence and resulting economic severity of the cyber threats facing businesses. [[Link](

* Invited to attend Full-Stack Deep Learning Bootcamp at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research at the University of California, Berkeley. Received Turnitin Scholarship for the program.

### 2018
* Graduated from Cornell University. Class of 2018! [[Tweet](https://twitter.com/CornellInfoSci/status/1000490385699991552)]
* Built clear.ai - an affordable assistive technology for the visually impaired, powered by Computer Vision. Collaborated with a multi-disciplinary team for this project. clear.ai was selected as one of Cornell Tech’s “Tech with a Purpose” products. [[Press](https://tech.cornell.edu/news/video-tech-with-a-purpose/)]
* Interviewed Eric Schmidt, Technical Advisor at Alphabet Inc. (previously CEO and executive chairman of Google), on his idea of groundbreaking technology, content moderation on search/video platforms, and social good. [[Tweet](https://twitter.com/trishalaneeraj/status/969640286132559877)]

### 2017
* Selected to represent the student body at Cornell Tech Campus Dedication ceremony. Received a shout-out from the Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo.

* Paper accepted at Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2017). [[Link](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM17/paper/view/15630/14864)]
* Interned at BuzzFeed Data Science Team. [[Blog](https://tech.buzzfeed.com/how-we-tagged-14-000-buzzfeed-quizzes-using-k-means-clustering-95fc46bc6daf)]

### 2016
* Selected to be part of a multi-disciplinary team of graduate students to work with the Customer Support Applications team at Google NYC, to specifically work on the problem of low response rate for customer satisfaction surveys. [[Press](https://tech.cornell.edu/news/product-challenge-google-cio/)]
* Graduate student researcher at [Social Technologies Lab](https://s.tech.cornell.edu/) at Cornell. Advised by Mor Naaman, I began research at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, and Investigative Journalism & Online Trust.
* Received the Jacobs Technion - Cornell Institute Scholarship to attend graduate school at Cornell Tech, Cornell University in Fall 2016.


### 2015
* Visiting Research Scholar at Predictive Technology Lab, University of Virginia. Advised by Matthew Gerber, I contributed to running experiments using [Sensus](https://predictive-technology-laboratory.github.io/sensus/) and collecting data that helped manage risk information in a personalized and context-sensitive manner - designed and developed for research in public health and personal safety.
