Hi, my name is Trishala Neeraj. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at CyberCube where I use a wide variety of data to determine organizations’ cyber-risk profiles. 

I obtained my Master's degree in Information and Computer Science at Cornell University, based in New York City at Cornell Tech. My research, advised by [Mor Naaman](https://people.jacobs.cornell.edu/mor/), was focused on developing tools to assist investigative journalism, by using methods in Information Retrieval. I took coursework in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, and was part of the teaching staff for [CS 5785 Applied Machine Learning](https://cornelltech.github.io/cs5785-fall-2017/index.html) for Fall 2017. During graduate school, I also spent some time learning and thinking about the [human and social aspects of technology](https://medium.com/p/66120ec11854#f79f), and contributed directly to ongoing research in the topics of Trust and Computational Social Science ([AAAI 2017](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM17/paper/view/15630/14864)). Here’s a list of other select projects I’ve worked on in the recent years - 
* [Blog post describing my work](https://tech.buzzfeed.com/how-we-tagged-14-000-buzzfeed-quizzes-using-k-means-clustering-95fc46bc6daf ) as an intern at BuzzFeed Data Science group
* Cornell Tech - Google [Product Challenge](https://tech.cornell.edu/news/product-challenge-google-cio/)

Prior to coming to pursue my Masters, I got my engineering degree from BITS Pilani, India. I was a research intern at the Predictive Technology Lab at the University of Virginia, where I worked on [Project Sensus](https://predictive-technology-laboratory.github.io/sensus/) as part of my Bachelor’s thesis.
