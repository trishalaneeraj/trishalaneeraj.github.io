Hello! My name is Trishala and I am currently a graduate student at Cornell University at Cornell Tech. My academic interests include natural language processing and machine learning. 

In this blog, I plan to write about some of the projects I have worked on and interesting papers that I have read. I believe that being able the explain clearly is the best way to validate one's own understanding of ideas. I have been meaning to set up a blog like this one for a long time, and I am very excited that I am finally doing this! 

Some of the projects I have recently worked on include my [summer internship project](https://goo.gl/fe8Awr) at BuzzFeed Data Science, and a [publication](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM17/paper/view/15630/14864) in AAAI 2017. I was also part of the teaching staff for [CS 5785 Applied Machine Learning](https://cornelltech.github.io/cs5785-fall-2017/index.html) in Fall 2017, for which I assisted with grading assignments and exams, and also helped with other logistics for the course taken by about 160 graduate students.

Prior to coming to pursue my Masters, I got my engineering degree from BITS Pilani, India. I was a research intern at the [Predictive Technology Lab](http://ptl.sys.virginia.edu/ptl/) at University of Virginia. There I worked on Project Sensus as part of my Bachelor's thesis.
